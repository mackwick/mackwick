## Introduction

I am a detail-oriented full-stack software engineer with a passion for creativity, a background in award-winning written communication, and a drive to build eye-catching software that helps people live easier, more meaningful lives.

I grew up in an artistic household that prioritized curiosity and self-exploration, so I‚Äôm committed to examining what it means to be my best self alone, in relationships, and in my communities. I‚Äôm excited about building products that encourage intentional living, introspection, and connection.
